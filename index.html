				How do we make it?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The mushroom that we make is 100% pure organic as we harvest it from our farms which utilize the organic methods of farming to produce the mushroom. And unlike other products which human use for food nowadays like the green vegetables, these mushrooms do not use any chemicals in the farming process. This makes it the best choice for those who are often sensitive to all the chemicals that we consume from the foods we eat

			<h2>How do you store Mushroom</h2>
			<p>
				Avoid storing mushrooms in the moisty environment or near foods with strong odor or flavors because they'll absorb them like a sponge, Do not stack other foods ontop of the mushrooms as yuou will bruise them, Most mushrooms hold up better in cold so if you want to store them for more than a week consider freezing them or drying them.

			<h2>How do you cook Mushrooms</h2>
			<p>
				The simple rules to follow when cooking mushrooms are as follows. Cut or tear them to a similar size, Don't crowd the mushrooms in the pan, Salt the mushrooms at the end of cooking and another best thing to do when cooking any type of mushroom is "Keep them dry" since they are spongy they'll absorb a lot of water so try to use as little water as possible.
